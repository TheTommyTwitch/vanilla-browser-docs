# Bonus Section!

So you've finished the workshop before everyone else, or you're looking for some more challenging peices to work on? You've come to the right section!

The following are some sections that will provide the beginnings to some self-guided learning experiences that build on the skills we've learned in this workshop.

## ES2015

You'll probably remember that the boilerplate for this workshop was setup with [Gulp][gulp]. If you take a peak at the `tasks/` directory at the `scripts` task and see how the scripts are being built you will notice the use of [Browserify][browserify] and the 'babelify' tranform which uses [Babel][babel].

Babel allows us to use ES2015 in the browser. There are many different plugins and presets you can add to the project's Babel configuration in `.babelrc`. The default [es2015][babel-es2015] preset should get you pretty far, but it would be useful to read up more information about Babel presets and plugins. Adding different plugins allows you to add more natively unsupported future features of EcmaScript.

Browserify allows us to use
